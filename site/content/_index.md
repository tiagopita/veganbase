  heading: Why did we build Veganbase?
  text: >-
    We care about the planet we live in. We believe that making veganism
    mainstream will help to address the world’s biggest social and environmental
    problems.

    To build a strong vegan economy we need to connect and empower vegan
    businesses.

    At Veganbase we want to promote vegan entrepreneurship and bring together
    vegan companies so they can easily find each other and cooperate.

    We want plant based products to be easy to find and accessible, so we
    brought them all together into one place.
