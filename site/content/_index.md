  heading: Why did we build Veganbase?
  text: >
    We think that to build a strong vegan economy we need to connect and empower
    vegan businesses.

    We want to promote vegan entrepreneurship and bring together vegan companies
    so they can easily find each other and cooperate.

    We want plant based products to be easy to find and accessible, so we
    brought them all together into one place. Promoting a vegan lifestyle we
    created a guide that will lead you to all the vegan places around the world
    and lifestyle magazine with articles created by our community.

    We care about the planet we live in. We believe that making veganism
    mainstream will help to address the world’s biggest social and environmental
    problems.
