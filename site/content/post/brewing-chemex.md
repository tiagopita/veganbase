Why and how we do it?



We aim to build a strong vegan economy by connecting and empowering vegan businesses.

 We want to promote vegan entrepreneurship. We bring together vegan companies and businesses so they can easily find each other and cooperate. 

We want plant based products to be easy to find and accessible, so we brought them all together into one place, Veganbase.com.

We want to promote vegan lifestyle. Thatâ€™s why we created a guide that will lead you to all the vegan places around the world and lifestyle magazine with articles created by our community.

We care about the planet we live in. We believe that making veganism mainstream will help to address the worldâ€™s biggest social and environmental problems.
