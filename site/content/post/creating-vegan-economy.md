  Imagine, the whole world is vegan. You go shopping to a local supermarket and
  you don’t have to look for V-labeled plant based brands, carefully checking
  products if they were animal tested or not… In the supermarkets everything is
  vegan now.

Your parents invite you for a Sunday barbecue. Your mum prepares delicious almond milk ice-cream… your dad roasts tasty alternative meat burgers. They also invite their neighbours and they bring a wonderful vegan cake with them. Your kids go to school, where there is no vegan lunch meal option because all the meals served in the canteen are plant based. There are only fake leather boots in the shoe shop on the corner. No one wears fur. Of course, all the restaurants are vegan. Moreover, everywhere you go, you can take your dog with you. And nobody asks you about your protein intake! There are no industrial animal farms any more, there is no animal exploitation and no testing on them. We live in the cruelty free world. For vegans this would be a perfect world… Does it sound too good to be true?

Imagine, that with generosity, compassion, cooperation and a little bit of effort, in fifty years, this could be our reality. How can we get close to that?

**Vegan economy**

We can get there through supporting ethical entrepreneurship and creating a vegan business economy. That means creating vegan business opportunities and supporting each other business activities. We need to organize a strong community cooperation and build a substantial infrastructure of successful vegan companies and brands to assure that a vegan lifestyle is easy and accessible to everyone, everywhere.

Why is this so important?

**Vegan economy values**

Business is the form of activism.

Socially and environmentally responsible investing is a hot topic these days.Big brands are already prepared, removing animal products from their offers.We don’t have to support their growth. We don’t have to choose between giving up our beliefs while spending or investing money. We should focus more on the cause and follow an ethical approach to investing which is socially responsible, environmentally friendly, sustainable and cruelty-free. For that reason vegans should advocate vegan projects, invest their money in vegan ventures, funding the projects and startups that focus on the change and build a grown vegan supply chain. Vegans should support ethical business ideas that contribute to vegan economy growth and its development. Through these business solutions we can demonstrate our ethical beliefs and contribute to the veganism movement.

**Community support and compassion for the cause.**

Sharing compassion for the cause and supporting each other is what makes it successful. We can explain that in a few simple examples: Need a plumber? Find a plumber who is vegan. Need a house design? Employ a vegan architect. Running a vegan restaurant? Recruit vegan staff. Services are a significant part of the economy. All sectors of the economy are interconnected through services. In all the sector of the economy there are vegan professionals. We need to attract and connect vegans to our businesses, bring companies created by vegans to cooperate and support vegan entrepreneurship initiatives, even the smallest ones.

**Vegan business infrastructure**

With these little steps we can focus on building a solid vegan business infrastructure. Making vegans collaborating will make our community grow stronger. Cooperation between vegans through commercially oriented activities will help veganism to grow stronger and eventually everyone will benefit from that personally.

We created Veganbase to get vegans connected and cooperate. Veganbase is an online platform to promote vegan lifestyle. It will be the resource of vegan products, services, places and jobs. We are building the base, the online foundation of the future vegan economy infrastructure. We want to make vegan lifestyle easier and accessible to everyone, everywhere. We believe this is the best way to make veganism mainstream. The more vegans support vegan businesses, the more likely they will succeed and promote their services to non vegans so a vegan lifestyle will be no more only a matter of ethical choice, it will become a common lifestyle standard.

This should be an essential future vegan movement strategy. 

To be seen in fifty years… 

 Vegans are coming!
