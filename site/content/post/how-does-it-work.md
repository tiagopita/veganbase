Lovinâ€™ it

When you see ðŸ’š green love hearts around Veganbase, you can use them to show your love for products. This will help Veganbase draw more attention to the best products, and also rewards the people who discovered them.

Weâ€™ll also keep track of the stuff you love, and make it easier for you to find later.

Your wishlist

Veganbase lets you add items to your wishlist. You can build up a list of things you want to try, and even share your list with others.

Weâ€™ll also count how many people add things to their wishlists to help decide on product popularity. We plan to share this information with brands to encourage them to make their products available in more places.
